    "When writing float numbers in Python, the easiest way to do so is just to plainly write the number, for example 4.73854 or 0.0035. Though if the numbers start to become really large or really small for example (~$10^{12}$) or (~$10^{-8}$), it will start to become really time consuming to write the entire number out. In addition it is easier for mistakes to be made writing long numbers yourself. Since accuaraccy is really important we therfor use scientific notation on large or small numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we can write large numbers like 7.2 billion like 7.2 × 10 $^{9}$ and 0.0000000319 3.19 × 10$^{-8}$ using multiplication (`*`) and powers (`**`) like so: `3.0*10**9` and `3.19*10 **(-10)`. This will give the right result but use time everytime it runs to calculate the number thorugh the equation. Instead of this we can use the notation of `e` (which in this case is not related to the constant) to write the numbers like so: `3.0e9` and `3.19e-10`. The `e` in this case is the 10's power. Doing it this way will make the number a constant instead of having to be calculated every time the program runs. This example can be seen in line 3 of the example below:\n",
